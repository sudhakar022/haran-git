To Add Certificate Manually

sudo ln -s /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/* /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts/
sudo c_rehash /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts/

(64-bit only) Enable i386 Multiarch
Even the Citrix Receiver for 64-bit systems has a lot of dependencies on packages from the i386 architecture. If you are using 64-bit Ubuntu and have not already configured i386 multiarch, you must configure it by running:


sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update


sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/icaclient_*.deb ctxusb_*.deb
sudo apt-get -f install  # Install dependencies and finish configuring the package(s)


sudo ln -s /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/* /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts/
sudo c_rehash /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts/


/opt/Citrix/ICAClient/util/configmgr &


7. (64-bit only) Fix Firefox plugin installation
Run:

sudo rm -f /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/npwrapper.npica.so /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/npwrapper.npica.so
sudo rm -f /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/npica.so
sudo ln -s /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/npica.so /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/npica.so
sudo ln -s /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/npica.so /usr/lib/firefox-addons/plugins/npica.so
Starting with Citrix Receiver 13.1, the 64-bit version of Citrix Receiver switched from a 32-bit plugin (using nspluginwrapper to allow it to run within a 64-bit browser) to a native 64-bit plugin. However, the install script still configures the plugin to run within nspluginwrapper, which doesn't work with a 64-bit plugin. The above will reconfigure the plugin to run without nspluginwrapper.

8. Configure Firefox
In Firefox, go to Tools -> Add-ons -> Plugins, and make sure the "Citrix Receiver for Linux" plugin is set to "Always Activate".

Starting in Firefox 32, plugins are set to "Ask to Activate" by default, but for some reason the activation prompt is never displayed for the Citrix Receiver plugin, so the plugin will not work unless it is set to "Always Activate".

9. Configure Chrome/Chromium
To use Citrix Receiver in Chrome and/or Chromium, run:

xdg-mime default wfica.desktop application/x-ica





Known Issues / Workarounds
If you are running KDE 4.10 or later: In System Settings, make sure GTK is set to a theme other than Oxygen. The Oxygen theme seems to cause the Citrix Receiver to constantly crash when trying to launch fullscreen applications (such as Terminal Servers or VDI).

Some people have experienced problems with Citrix Receiver 13.0 showing only random fragments of windows. It is not clear if this is a bug in the graphics library that Citrix has adopted with this version and/or its interaction with certain Citrix server configurations. If you experience this, you are likely to have better success with version 12.1, see CitrixICAClientHowToOlderVersions. The behavior of Citrix Receiver 13.1 for the affected people has not yet been determined.

Sometimes the Citrix client will not go full-screen with Unity. The Unity launcher and status bar will still be visible, and the Citrix mouse will be in a slightly different position than the client mouse. This can be fixed enabling legacy fullscreen in compizconfig-settings-manager. It is in 'advanced search' then 'Plugin: workarounds', then second on the list.

You can exit from the FULL SCREEN mode (in Unity) by pressing Ctrl+F2 followed by Ctrl+Super+Arrow_Down.
You can prevent Citrix from starting FULL SCREEN by opening a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), gedit ~/.ICAClient/All_Regions.ini and setting DesiredHRES=1366 and DesiredVRES=768 for example.
You can solve keyboard layout problems looking for your keyboard layout in http://support.citrix.com/proddocs/topic/receivers-java-101/java-parameters-keyboard-layouts.html and updating KeyboardLayout value in ~/.ICAClient/wfclient.ini`

There is a bug in Citrix Receiver 13.1.0.285639, that the receiver can not be started from unity. The problem is a missing hash in a parameter, as a workaround it can be fixed by executing the follwing command. The problem and and solution are also described here: http://discussions.citrix.com/topic/358076-deb-package-uses-icaroot-instead-of-icaroot-spelling-error/#entry1844542
